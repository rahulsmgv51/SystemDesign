## SOLID Design Principles - Open Closed Principle (OCP) for Clean Code
* Software entities(Classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- `Open for extension`: This means that the behavior of a software module (such as a class or function) can be extended without altering its source code.

- `Closed for modification`: Once a module is written and tested, it should not be modified. Instead, new behavior should be added in a way that doesn't impact existing code.

- `A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification`. This means you should be able to change the behavior of a class without changing its source code. You do this through polymorphism and interfaces (or abstract classes).
